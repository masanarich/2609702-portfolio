            <p>
                Hi, I’m Faranani Maduwa. I’m a university student interested in software development and building useful
                systems that solve real problems.
                I enjoy learning by doing, and I’m improving my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
            </p>

            <p>
                I like working on projects that mix logic and creativity. My goal is to become a strong developer who
                can build clean, reliable apps and
                collaborate well in a team using tools like GitHub.
            </p>

            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>
                One of my recent projects is a simple portfolio website using semantic HTML5. I used Git branches to
                develop features safely, then merged
                them into the main branch. Next, I want to add a real Projects section and publish the site on GitHub
                Pages.
