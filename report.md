In this lab I learned the difference between Git and GitHub and how version control helps track changes in a project.  
I created a repository, cloned it locally, and practiced using git init, add, commit, and push.  
I also learned how to create a feature branch, switch between branches, and merge changes back into main.  
Finally, I used semantic HTML5 elements to structure a portfolio page and styled it using an external CSS file.
